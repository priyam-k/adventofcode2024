my code for the 2024 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenge!

for each day, there is an input file (dayX_INPUT.txt) with the raw input, as well as two files for each challenge of the day (dayX-1.py and dayX-2.py)

my focus is on minimizing # lines of code, but I left some comments at the top of each file to try and explain what my code does!
